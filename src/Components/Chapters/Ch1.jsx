                    C++ is a popular programming language (extension of C
                    language) created by a Danish Computer Scientist, Bjarne
                    Stroustrup in early 80`s.

                  <li>
                    The language was updated 4 major times in 2011, 2014, 2017,

                      <span>
                        C++ allows for low-level memory manipulation and direct
                        hardware access, which results in efficient code
                        execution.

                      <span>
                        C++ supports OOP which enables modular and organized
                        code, promotes code reuse, and enhances maintainability
                        and scalability of projects.

                      <span>
                        C++ provides a powerful library called the Standard
                        Template Library (STL), which offers a collection of
                        generic data structures (like vectors, lists, and
                        queues) and algorithms (like sorting and searching).

                        C++ code can be compiled and run on various platforms,

                      <span>
                        : C++ is an extension of the C programming language. C++
                        compilers can compile most C programs with few
                        modifications, making it easy to integrate existing C
                        code into C++ projects.

                        C++ is widely used in various industries, including game
                        development, system programming, finance, and embedded

                      <span>
                        Learning C++ can provide a solid foundation in
                        programming concepts and principles. C++ requires a good
                        understanding of memory management, pointers, and other
                        low-level details, which can enhance your overall
                        programming skills and prepare you for learning other
                        languages and technologies. As C++ is close to C, C# and
                        java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++
                        or vice versa.{" "}

              <p>
                As C++ is derived from C, both have almost the same syntax. C++
                compilers can compile most C programs with few modifications,
                making it easy to integrate existing C code into C++ projects.
