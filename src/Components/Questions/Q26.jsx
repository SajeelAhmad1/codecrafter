        <b>Q1: </b>Implement a class named shape and make its three child classes - square, circle and reactangle. 
        Now define a function in base class calcArea() and simple print "Calculating area". 
        Now override this function in child classes. For example, in square, this function should return 
        area of square by using formula of area of square. Make objects and print areas of different 
        shapes on screen.<br />
        <b>Q2: </b>Write a program to implement a base class and implement two method in it. 
        First method should take two parameters - length and width and return their sum and the other 
        function should take three parameters - length, width and height and return their product. 
        Now make two instances of class with different arguments and print results on screen. <br />
        <b>Q3: </b>Identify the type of polymorphism in Q1 and Q2 (theory type question). <br />
