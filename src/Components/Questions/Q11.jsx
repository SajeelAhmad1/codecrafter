        <b>Q1: </b>Write a program to input two integer values and find out whether the first or the second input number is greater. <br />
        <b>Q2: </b>Write a program to calculate the electricity bill. The rates of electricity per unit are as follow: 1. If the units consumed are greater or equal to 100 then the cost is Rs 8/- per unit and surcharge of 5% of the bill is added. 2. If the units consumed are less than 100 then the cost is Rs 5.5/- per unit and no surcharge is added. <br />
        <b>Q3: </b>Write a C++ program to input two values from the keyboard and to print the larger number on the computer screen. <br />
        <b>Q4: </b>Write a program to input three integer values. Compare the three values to find out if they are equal. Print the message “All values are equal” if they are equal. Otherwise print the message “These values are different”. Use nested if else. <br />
        <b>Q5: </b>Write a program to input three integers from the keyboard. Find out the greatest number and print it on the screen. <br />
        <b>Q6: </b>Take 3 inputs from the users, two numbers and one operator and perform calculation on numbers on the basis of operator. <br />
        <b>Q7: </b>Write a program to input a number from keyboard and then print the message “It is an odd number” if it is an odd number else print “it is an even number”. <br />
        <b>Q8: </b>Write a program to input two integer and then find out whether both numbers are divisible by 2 or not. If they are divisible print the message “numbers are divisible” else print “numbers are not divisible”. <br />
        <b>Q9: </b>Write a program to find out the grade of the student based on the marks obtained in three subjects. The grade is calculated as: 1. If the average is greater than 80 grade is ‘A’. 2. If average is less than 80 and greater than 50 grade is ‘B’. 3. If average is less than 50 and greater than 33 then the grade is ‘C’. 4. If average is less than 33 grade is ‘F’. <br />
        <b>Q10: </b>Write a program in C++ to input 4 integers. Find out the largest value and then print it on the screen by using nested if structure. <br />
        <b>Q11: </b>Write a program that prompts the user to input a number. The program should then output the number and a message saying whether the number is positive, negative, or zero. <br />
        <b>Q12: </b>Write a program to input an integer value. Test the integer value if the value is divisible by 2 then print the message “Divisible by 2” otherwise “Not divisible by 2” by using switch statement. <br />
