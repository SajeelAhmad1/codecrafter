        <b>Q1: </b>Write a function to swap values of two integers and print the new values on screen. <br />
        <b>Q2: </b>Write a program to pass two variables as arguments to the function to calculate their sum and print them on the screen. <br />
        <b>Q3: </b>Write A program that inputs two numbers in main function and passes these numbers to a function. The function displays the maximum no. <br />
        <b>Q4: </b>Write a program that take to two numbers in main function and passes the numbers to a function by reference. The function then swaps the value and display. <br />
        <b>Q5: </b> Write a program to find a number and its location in the array using a function. <br />
        <b>Q6: </b>Write a program that inputs a no. in main function and passes the no. to a function. Print the table of that number. <br />
        <b>Q7: </b>Write a program to check whether a entered no. is prime no, even no. or odd no. using function. (it must cover all possibilities) Hint : “2 is a prime even no.” <br />
        <b>Q8: </b>Write a program inputs a no. and a character in main function and passes them to a function. It then displays a square of that entered character against the no. of rows user entered. Hint: if user enter 4 and @, it displays output as follows: <br />
        @@@@  <br />
        @@@@  <br />
        @@@@ <br />
        @@@@ <br />
        <b>Q9: </b>Write a program to sort an array in ascending order using function. <br />
        <b>Q10: </b>Write a program for calculator that input two no.s and one arithmetic operator in main function and pass them to a function. The function applies arithmetic operation on two numbers on the basis of the operator entered by the user using switch statement. <br />
        <b>Q11: </b>Write a program to find the factorial of a given number by using function and also by using reference parameters. <br />
